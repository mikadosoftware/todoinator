Future goals
------------

I want a complete text based project planning system, using text to define
the product, using markup to identify *features* and hence *milestones* and
a project plan (without dates) to be created.

Velocity can be inferred from the milestone completion process, with optional
story point sizing.

My only text-based issue is that if sub-tasks.

f`the helicopter can be flown upside down` makes this a feature request (which is a milestone).


f`the helicopter can be flown upside down`
    f`the helicopter seatbelts must be tight`
    f`the helicopter petrol tank must work upside down`
    	      f`the helicopter petrol tank must use pump not gravity feed`
    f`the helicopter must be blue`
